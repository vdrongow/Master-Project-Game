# Sorting Game

## Overview
The Sorting Game is a digital serious game developed in Unity, aimed at teaching students various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. The game provides an interactive and engaging way to understand these algorithms through step-by-step sorting and visual feedback.

A demo build is available [here](https://vdrongow.github.io/Sort-Game/). 
It requires a desktop browser with support for WebAssembly and WebGL.

## Features
- Implementation of three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort
- Interactive game play with real-time feedback and visual cues
- Data tracking for learning analytics integration
    - The game can be played alone or in combination with a [Learning Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/vdrongow/Master-Project-Dashboard)
- Adaptive learning environment using the [adlete framework](https://gitlab.com/adaptive-learning-engine)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vdrongow/Master-Project-Game.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity (Version 2022.3.30).
3. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
4. Build and run the game.

## Usage
1. Launch the game.
2. Log in to the game using the room code from the session started with the Dashboard, or play offline.
3. Select a sorting algorithm to learn.
4. Sort the Array steb-by-step using the left and right arrow keys. Press the left arrow key if the two highlighted elements are not sorted correctly and need to be swapped. Press the right arrow when the elements are sorted correctly.
5. The game tracks your inputs and gives you feedback on your performance.
